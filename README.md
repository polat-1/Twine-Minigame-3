# Twine Minigame 3
## Devlog
I have 3 variables in my game. $haskey is to detect whether the player has found the key. $lefthand is to detect whether or not the player has lost their left hand. $deaths is to track the player's death count, which will be displayed at the end of the game. I used if and else macros generally to make more specific adjustments to the player's gameplay, based on certain conditions from variables. An example of this is an if statement to check if the player had the key to unlock the door.
